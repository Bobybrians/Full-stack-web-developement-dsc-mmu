       <header>
           here i have my navigation menu and anything i want to appear in the header section
           <nav>

           </nav>
       </header>
       <main>
           here is where i want to have the main content of my page.
           everything about my page and what i want to tell users should be here.
           <section>
               this are used to divide main section into differen divisions they are moreless similar to <div></div>
               but they sematically correct to use.

               inside the section, we may have some other less important content and images.
               that is the where we need the <aside> this is used to have a side aligned content</aside>
           </section>

           the second last tag to discus is table tag
           so we can use table to diaplay our information
           the first tag here is 
           <table>
            <caption> this is used to caption our table</caption>
             <thead>
                 this is where the heading of the table should be
             </thead>
             <tbody>
                 this where the table body should be 
             </tbody>
             <tfoot>
                 this is the table footer
             </tfoot>
           </table>
           sorry i was forgeting this one
           the paragraph
           <p> here is where we can have our content displayed.</p>
       </main>
       the final thing i want to mention and dwel more on it next time is 
       <form action="">
           this is very interesting and used for user interactivity.
           this is where the developer interact with the use of the web or page. user information or opinions can be 
           captured by use of forms. forms are very interesting. so more ont it next time.

       </form>
       <footer>
           this is where you have footer section
           this is the bottom most section of your page
           it may contain thing like copy right and etc.
       </footer>
